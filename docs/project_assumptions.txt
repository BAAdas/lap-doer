LAP-DOER 
-----------
Lap time simulator using 4-wheeled car model including tire model (define which model).

Damping, springs, chassis stiffeness not included for now.

Igor Wants:
- to be able to add diferent tracks, tests, challanges
- to plausibly change tyre models and simulation metodologies
- to suck dick all day all night 24/365

Adam Wants:
    1. to prioritize working solutions over "cleen" or "sexy" or "optimal" ones
    2. documented decisions, while making decision you need to answer question why and hold it up to academic standards 
        - put an answer to why? in comments, especialy when the answer to this question is arbitral or academia driven
    3. to create code with forsight in mind, do not create code and shiet just for now 
        - modular design, allways think what if this module is gona be replaced in the future (if aplicable of corse, simply think)
    4. to aim to make this solution the best that we can, use the best solution not the easiest 
    5. to plan twice and do once, or smth   

Targets:
 
1. Understanding of vehicle sensitivity for different parameters,
2. Measurable and data-driven targets for other projects,
3. Supporting drivers in finding car limits,
4. Estimation of lap times and better preparation for competitions,
5. Finding ideal setup for optimal tire usage



Adam thinks this project should:
    - give standarized output
    - take diferent standards as an input
